    After installation, close and reopen your terminal (or run `source ~/.bashrc` / `source ~/.zshrc`).

2.  **Install Node.js:**
    Install the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js using `nvm`:

    ```bash
    nvm install --lts
    nvm use --lts
    nvm alias default --lts
    ```
